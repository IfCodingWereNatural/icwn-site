1. Don't listen to these guys (Prime, Theo, TJ, etc.)
   - I picked these channels because my channel analytics show channels my viewers also watch, and also
     because I'm subscribed to them.
1. Okay, I don't mean you should unsubscribe from them and not listen to anything they say, but
   they are not the arbiters of truth. Also, I put myself on the list of people you shouldn't listen to.
1. Allow yourself to be influenced, but be careful about who you are influenced by, even
   well meaning individuals. And also, influence doesn't mean you have to think exactly like someone else
   does, it can just mean that you listen to someone else's viewpoint and take it into consideration.

The real danger I see with these tech influencers is they can come across as being
very confident and say really dumb things and make very misleading comments, and do so
very confidently.

For example, I just watched this video this morning, of course skipping to the end to see the
actual results, but I caught this part where Prime tries roasting vscode for it's supposed
inconsistency with creating files. Now, I'm not sure how he creates files in vim, but
this is how I create files. <show em>. To me, this looks awfully similar to how you
create files in vscode, minus I used my keyboard to navigate instead of a mouse.

And before one of you tells me in the comments why that's stupid, check
yourself, because the thing that makes it work is not about efficiency, it's
never about efficiency! Efficiency is always secondary to some other emotion or
need that is deeply human. it's about preference and how comfortable or
familiar you are with doing things a certain way. Show me two vim users who
have the exact same config, use the exact same keybinds, and have the exact
same workflow. It doesn't exist.

But, Prime really showed his ignorance here. In fact he says somewhere else in this video
that he used vscode for 10 days. 10 days isn't nothing, but it's not nearly
enough time to get really familiar with an IDE.

You could, theoretically, customize vscode in such a way that you never have to use
the mouse. In this way, on at least one fundamental level, vscode and neovim are the same.

...Okay, now tell me in the comments how I should actually create files in neovim,
I'm actually curious what I'm missing out on...

Take for example a fairly recent interview Prime had with a game engine
designer guy that was about preformance and how preformance is king and
developers have forgotten this and everyone sucks. Both of these guys are more
experienced than me, but now I'm going to say something confidently, that they
missed the mark.

Another one was a video by Theo that actually made me unsubscribe from him,
where he said "you might be using typescript wrong". I thought he got a lot of
things RIGHT in that video, but the way he ended was, yikes.

Maybe he was doing that for views, because controversy stirs up people's
emotions and that tends to drive engagement. But I personally feel that there's
a responsibility if you want to create educational content to not say stupid
stuff like that, because it hurts more than it helps.

One of the biggest challenges I've faced trying to make content on youtube, is
that I want everything I say to be very accurate. Or at least, I wanted to. But
that, it turns out, is really difficult. I was genuinely afraid of publishing
my video on microservices because I was afraid people would take things the
wrong way, or I wouldn't be precise enough in what I was trying to explain.
Even now I watch that video and there are several things I could nitpick on
that could easily be taken out of context.

And for creators who live stream, this must be an enormous challenge, because
sometimes we just say really stupid stuff and it's basically impossible to
perfectly filter everything we say and speak with exact precision. That would
be absolutely exhausting. My brain does that naturally, and it is exhausting.
It wants to explore every single branch of thought until I get absolutely lost
and have no idea what got me thinking the thing in the first place. It's also a
super power because I find myself considering things that no one else thought
to consider.
