This started out as favorite vim movements, but that's too restrictive? What
about movements I have through plugins? Maybe I could have a separate video for
commands?

If you're already a vim master, there won't be any surprises here, but if
you're new to vim, this list could be helpful.

Not listed in any particular order:

NOTE: This is a WIP.

- `gqq`/gww/vipgw
- all the change/delete/yank/visual-select inners/arounds: `(c|d|y)(i|a)('|"|p|w|(|[|{|t))`
- `:qa`, `:x`, `:xa` and `:wa`. I have `:w` on a keymap. (too lame?)
- macros.
- jump brackets (%) in combination with `<S-v>$%` to select blocks of code.
- `*` to highlight word under cursor.
- `.` to repeat commands
- `:%s` and `:'<,'>`
- `<C-i>` and `<C-o>`
- "Surround" variants such as `ysiw'` and `ds(`
- `:h`. Yep, I almost always find something new just by perusing the help docs.
