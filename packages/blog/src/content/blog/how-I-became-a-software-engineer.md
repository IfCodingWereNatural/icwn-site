Hey, how's it going everyone. I've seen a couple videos on how others became
software engineers, and I wanted to throw my story into the mix. I think
learning about other people's journey can be entertaining and informative, so
hopefully I can provide that in this video.

Looking back on life, I've come a long, long way. And it's not been easy.

But also, it's been a minute since my last video because... life.

And I told myself when I started this channel that I wouldn't prioritize it
over my health and well-being. Anyway, no one cares about that. But I left off
talking about my "plink" plugin for neovim, and right after my last video my
family got covid and then things at work got kind of crazy and I got a new dog
and also the barber I had been going to moved out of state.

Man, so much can happen in such a short period of time.

But I do have content planned around creating plugins for neovim -- there's
just so much there that I genuinely have no idea where to start.

But I have officially decided that the niche of this channel is going to be on:
exploring the mind of a software engineer with severe ADD (inattentive type)
with a clinical diagnosis of poor short term memory who can't settle down on a
niche for his youtube channel and who's also 99% sure he's on the spectrum of
autism. And no, that last part is not a joke.

When I graduated highschool in 2008, I thought my calling in life was going to
be music. I played the viola in my highschool orchestra, and I'm not gonna lie,
I was pretty good at it.

But I also knew musicians didn't tend to fare very well financially. It really
seems like one of those industries where you either make it or break it. As a
little extra background, my father died when I was only 1. I never knew him. So
my mother raised me and my siblings on her own. From the earliest I have
memories up until I was about a junior in highschool, my mom worked at least
three jobs in order to make ends meet.

Now that I have kids of my own, I seriously don't know how she managed to do
it. I remember feeling that stress as a kid, but now that I have kids of my
own, I can't imagine how overwhelming that must have felt for her.

With that in mind, some time after graduating, I began studying music at a
small community college, and after two semesters, I had really started to
question if music was what I really wanted to do with my life. And the idea of
scraping by with the stress of not knowing if I'd be able to provide for myself
and for a future family (because I wasn't married at the time) really weighed
on me. And so naturally, I decided to enlist in the United States Army.

While sitting here thinking about it, there's so much I could unpack here, but
I'm going to try keeping the focus on my path to becoming a software engineer.
But without trying to derail things too much, joining the army had, as one
might imagine, a huge impact on my life. I learned a lot about myself, such as:

- I had a leader inside of me: I'm actually a pretty reserved person, but
  I discovered that leading feels quite natural to me. And I'm not necessarily
  saying I'm a good leader, but I found time and time again when put into
  situations that tended to really get the nerves of most people, that I could
  just take it in stride.
- I also learned that I work really well under pressure, and can in fact thrive
  in a lot of high pressure situations.
- I also learned that I have very little patience for putting up with pointless
  crap -- something the army happens to be very full of.

Anyway, being more specific, I joined the Army Reserve so that I could go back
to school while still serving. This was back in 2012, which happened to be
around the time the troop surge in Afghanistan was just about to slow down. But
this meant sign-on bonuses and education benefits were at all time highs. When
I joined, it was because I was feeling kind of aimless in life and felt a
genuine desire to be part of something bigger than myself. And my dad was
actually in the army when he died -- he died of cancer, it had nothing to do
with actually serving in the military -- and my grandpa had also served, and
that really inspired me to join. But the education benefits were also a big
draw. And like I said, because I was in the Reserves, that meant I could still
attend college.

But for some reason, I didn't go back to school for another two years after
finishing basic training. Man, I really don't know what I was thinking. Well, I
was definitely battling some inner demons and struggling with pretty bad
depression at the time.

Regardless, I started attending a 4-year university in 2014 and enrolled in a
bunch of introductory computer science courses. This was actually kind of
difficult for me because, even though I had loved technology and computers
growing up, my older brother also happened to be the president of the high
school computer club. Like that was his thing, and my thing was music. So there
was a little bit of an identity crisis I had to overcome there, but eventually
I was like, screw it, I'm not going to NOT pursue something that sounds really
interesting to me because it's something that ALSO happens to be an interest of
my brother. But I remember going through what actually felt like the birth of
the internet.

But, I was still really struggling with depression. And I started taking a
bunch of these computer science courses and I sucked at it. But another thing
I've learned about myself, and what I consider to be the number 1 personality
trait I contribute to my success, is: I don't know when to quit. Like, most of
the time, not in a good way. But I'll just stubbornly pursue something (usually
things that are completely inconsequential) even at the cost of my mental,
physical, and spiritual health, until I finally get it. And that's what I was
doing in these courses. I would go to the computer lab after classes every
single day to get help from the tutors, even though I hate talking to people,
and like, really struggle through these different assignments, all of which
were in C++ -- a language that is NOT beginner friendly (although I highly
recommend it). This was also the very beginning of my journey into figuring out
that if I don't give up trying to learn something, eventually, I'll get it. And
I strongly believe that's not just a "me" thing; I believe that's a universal
truth. The amount of pain you might have to go through can be staggering, but
I've gotten to the point where I'll have something I'm trying to learn, or
figure out (it could be learning a new language (can anyone say Rust?),
debugging a problem that makes absolutely no sense, or learning a new code
base, or even non-programming relating things like fixing a car) and I'll like
have this tightness in my chest and my head will be pounding and I'll have that
feeling of total hopelessness like I've fallen into the quagmire of despair
from which there is no deliverance... and be like, "yeah, we're on the right
track".

Man, I get side tracked so easily, where was I...

Right, so I'm super depressed and really struggling in these computer science
courses, but during the same time, I was feeling really fed up with my work
situation. I worked almost exclusively in the food industry up to this point in
life, and if you've worked in the food industry, you know how horrible it can
be. You get paid absolute garbage, and put up with absolute pricks, comprised
of rude customers and toxic coworkers and bosses, and one of my favorites:
nepotism! Where coworkers who are clearly far less experienced than you get
paid more, get to work the best shifts, and get preferential treatment even
though you gave up being a baker, which was actually a really fun job that I
quit because the nice old lady I worked with said her new husband would give me
a better life at his new shop making donuts!

Yeah, I'm lookin' at you Johnny O's.

Wow, is this is quickly devolving. I clearly still have a chip on my shoulder.

I actually had some really great managers at a few places. And also, if you're
watching this video and we used to work together at Jimmy Johns and I ever
stepped out of line, I'm really sorry. I was in a tough place in life at that
time.

MAN. Have I mentioned I get sidetracked easily yet?

Okay, focus. Focus.

Right, so I had also just quit as a personal trainer. (Yeah, I was a personal
trainer at one point in my life too). And I loved the working out part, and the
biomechanics, and teaching lifting technique, and calculating macros and
adjusting diets, but in that job I REALLY REALLY learned that I can't work with
people. Not in an "unable to work with people" way, just in a "interacting with
people all day is insanely draining and not sustainable for me" kind of way.

So I quit being a donut maker and personal trainer and I swore to myself that
my next job would not be in food service... or involve talking to people a lot
(like a call center job or summer sales type work was completely off the
table).

You know, as kids, I remember everyone saying "I don't care what I am when I
grow up, I just don't want to sit behind a desk". Well at this point, I was
like, "Desk job baby! That's the dream!"

So I started applying to jobs and found a job post for a part-time IT support
specialist at an organization funded by the university where it was located
just off campus. I applied and got called in for an interview. And I nearly
completely blew the interview because the manager asked me for an example of a
time I displayed leadership, and I told him a story about being a raid leader
for my guild in world of warcraft. (Good grief, it's not like I could have
talked about my military service and countless leadership opportunities
there... I think I had made the rank of sergeant by then and was a squad
leader. BUT, I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW it was during the Wrath of the Lich King
expansion which was the height of WoW). But we actually had a good laugh about
that, and I got hired.

And then, I had a coworker who was also a computer science major but about 2
years ahead of me. But this guy was a programming whiz. And he had also served
in the Army (which is honestly the main reason I got hired). But a big part of
the job was being a "web master", which meant manually editing HTML files and
uploading them to a server hosted on campus through FTP. You have to admire the
simplicity. However, my coworker convinced our boss to let us write a proper
website... in angularjs. And I loved it. I mean, angularjs sucked, but I
suddenly started to get it and realized that I loved solving hard problems.
Even my classes started to become fun and rewarding. Something about getting
into web development and working on projects that people actually used
completely ignited a passion. And I still have that passion up to this day.
Which is the main reason I decided to start this youtube channel, to share that
passion.

But man, I have so much more I could say, but I think I'll stop here for today.
I know that I enjoy hearing how people got their start in software engineering,
and hope that if you got anything out of MY story, it's that the most rewarding
things in life require doing hard things, sometimes extremely daunting, hard
things, and they require sacrifice, and also perseverance. I can't imagine how
completely different my life would be if I had decided to give up when I was
struggling through those computer science classes. There were things I
struggled so much with that are now _laughably_ easy.

I've learned that how easy or hard something is has almost nothing to do with
the difficulty of the subject matter, but everything to do with how much you
simply enjoy doing it. My passion for software development didn't ignite until
I saw how I could take something in my brain and turn it into something
tangible and useful. After that, everything else became so much easier, not
because it was any less difficult, but because I simply enjoyed the challenge
of mastering something that at first seemed nearly impossible.

Okay, I sense myself starting to go off on another rant. So, you know what to
do... Like, Subscribe, comment... all that stuff. _now get up and walk away_.

<!-- So this was back in 2012. I was 22 at the time, and I had just started basic -->
<!-- training at fort benning, GA. Before we were actually placed in a barracks, -->
<!-- everyone went through in-processing where they do the things like shave your -->
<!-- head, issue you a ton of equipment, and inject you with 20 different shots. -->
<!-- Honestly, I could have little nanobots in my blood stream right now and I'd -->
<!-- have no idea. But this in-processing took about three days. And I don't mean 3 -->
<!-- working days, I mean 3 straight days without sleep, standing in lines and being -->
<!-- shuffled around like sheep. -->

<!-- So by the time we got to our barracks, all of the recruits were completely exhausted. -->
<!-- Then, bright and early... actually it was still dark outside... the drill seargents burst -->
<!-- into the barracks, blowing air horns, whistles, and screaming at everyone to get up. -->

<!-- Alright, so I'm still absolutely exhausted, and in my exhausted state, I made -->
<!-- the mistake of going like this <make face raising eye brows>. And immediately -->
<!-- one of the drill sergeants sees me and goes, "PRIVATE, ARE YOU RAISING YOUR EYE -->
<!-- BROWS AT ME??!", and the next second I had at least 5 drill sergeants circled -->
<!-- around me; like I could literally feel spittle spraying onto my face. Anyway, I -->
<!-- had instantly branded myself as a trouble maker. -->

<!-- In basic training, the drill sergeants will seek out so called "trouble -->
<!-- makers". These are the recruits who always screw it up for everyone else. It's -->
<!-- a psychological tactic that's somehow supposed to build unity and "encourage" -->
<!-- self discipline. -->

<!-- Anyway, either that day or the next, we were tasked with organizing a shed full -->
<!-- of discarded gear from the group of recruits who had just come through. The -->
<!-- drill sergeants called out four recruits to come forward and put them in charge -->
<!-- of the platoon to clean and organize this shed. And you guessed it, I was one -->
<!-- of them. -->

<!-- And at that moment, I knew, like I just KNEW, I was put in charge of a task -->
<!-- that we were not meant to succeed in. During the first week or two or basic -->
<!-- training, you're meant to fail basically everything they throw at you. -->

<!-- But, we start organizing all this junk and the drill sergeants leave and say -->
<!-- they'll be back in like 20 minutes or something like that. But when time was -->
<!-- almost out, I assessed the situation and realized we had made a lot of -->
<!-- progress, but we weren't going to make it because panic was starting to set in -->
<!-- and also the drill sergeants were using the oldest trick in the book of putting -->
<!-- several people in charge instead of just 1, and also the entire platoon was -->
<!-- inside this small shed stepping on each others' toes. And in one of the -->
<!-- proudest moments of my life, I told everyone to stop what they were doing. And -->
<!-- everyone stopped. And I said, "look, this isn't working, but we're so close. We -->
<!-- can't all be in charge because I'm telling you to do this and that other guy is -->
<!-- telling you to do this other thing, and we're basically standing on top of each -->
<!-- other in here." And I was just like, hey, I'm the captain now. Then I made half -->
<!-- the platoon go outside and form up, and split the rest up into groups to take -->
<!-- care of picking up specific pieces of equipment, and as each group finished I -->
<!-- sent them outside, and within just a few minutes we were all done. I even had -->
<!-- time to make one last little sweep to make sure everything was in place, and as -->
<!-- I stood out in formation waiting for the drill sergeants to do their -->
<!-- inspection, I heard one of them say, "holy sh\*t, they actually did it". -->

<!-- 1. It was around this time I started learning... totally lost my train of thought here. -->
<!-- 2. I also started noticing that I noticed things that no one else seemed to -->
<!--    noticed, such as, cleaning a shed is really straight forward but having 4 people in charge -->
<!--    at the same time makes no sense. -->
<!-- 3. I also learned that I work really well under pressure. Now, dear wife, if -->
<!--    you're watching this, I'm not talking about the pressure of raising -->
<!--    children... our kids can be monsters... I just mean that I can actually -->
<!--    thrive when, uh, fecal matter hits the fan (trying to keep the language -->
<!--    clean). -->

<!-- So far, you might be asking what this has to do with how I became a software -->
<!-- engineer. Well, dear viewer, I like to think I've learned a few lessons on this -->
<!-- earth in my few short years. The first one here is, don't enlist in the -->
<!-- military to help pay for college. That's a losing battle and the military -->
<!-- always wins. That was my experience anyway. It might cover some of your -->
<!-- expenses -- but it ain't free. But the other thing is that hard things suck, -->
<!-- but they're worth it on the other side. And to really learn about yourself, -->
<!-- you've got to challenge yourself with hard things. For me, one of those things -->
<!-- was joining the military. Another one was finishing college -- but I think -->
<!-- that's for another story. -->
